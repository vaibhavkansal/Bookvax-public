The current pandemic situation is bad and it's important to get the covid vaccine to break the chain.
However we also understand how difficult the slot booking process is and it's frustrating to keep a track
of available slots in your location.
We bring this app to take away the stress you had to go through everytime
you wanted to check for available slots.This app will keep a track of that for you.
Let Covidax worry about tracking the slots for you , all you have to do is register with your correct pincode

as slots are available.
